# Installation on AWS EC2 CUDA Instances

This tutorial was tested on `g4dn.xlarge` instance with `Ubuntu 24.04` operating 
system. This tutorial was written explicitly to perform the installation on a `Ubuntu 24.04` machine.

## Installation Steps

1. Start an EC2 instance of any class with a GPU with CUDA support.  
    
    If you want to compile llama.cpp on this instance, you will need at least 4GB for CUDA drivers and enough space for your LLM of choice. I recommend at least 30GB. Perform the following steps of this tutorial on the instance you started.

2. Install build dependencies:
    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    ```
    ```shell
    sudo apt install build-essential ccache
    ```
   
3. Install NVIDIA Drivers:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install nvidia-driver-550-server nvidia-headless-550-server nvidia-utils-550-server
    ```

4. Install CUDA Toolkit (only the Base Installer). Download it and follow instructions from
  https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads  

    At the time of writing this tutorial, the highest available supported version of the Ubuntu version was 22.04. But do not fear! :) We'll get it to work with some minor workarounds (see the [Potential Errors](#potential-errors) section)

5. Compile llama.cpp:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
    ```
    ```shell
    cd llama.cpp
    ```
    ```shell
    LLAMA_CUDA=1 make -j
    ```
5. Benchmark llama.cpp (optional):

    Follow the official tutorial if you intend to run the benchmark. However, keep using `LLAMA_CUDA=1 make` to compile the llama.cpp (do *not* use `LLAMA_CUBLAS=1`):

    Instead of performing a model quantization yourself, you can download quantized models from Hugging Face. For example, `Mistral Instruct` you can download from https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/tree/main

## Potential Errors

### libtinfo5 is not installable

```
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 nsight-systems-2023.4.4 : Depends: libtinfo5 but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

It was removed from Ubuntu 24.04. One way to solve that is to add a repository
from Ubuntu 22.04 to your `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory and install it from 
there. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Enter `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory.
2. Create a new file for Ubuntu 22.04 sources:
    ```shell
    sudo nano jammy.sources
    ```

    Paste the following content into that file:

    ```
    Types: deb
    URIs: http://eu-central-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
    Suites: jammy jammy-updates jammy-backports
    Components: main universe restricted multiverse
    Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```
3. Run `sudo apt update`
4. Try repeating the installation step that cuased the error.

You might consider 
[APT pinning](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto) to pin that 
specific version of the library, although it might not be necessary.

### CUDA Architecture Must Be Explicitly Provided

```
ERROR: For CUDA versions < 11.7 a target CUDA architecture must be explicitly 
provided via environment variable CUDA_DOCKER_ARCH, e.g. by running 
"export CUDA_DOCKER_ARCH=compute_XX" on Unix-like systems, where XX is the 
minimum compute capability that the code needs to run on. A list with compute 
capabilities can be found here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
```

You need to check the mentioned page (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
and pick the appropriate version for your instance's GPU. `g4dn` instances 
use T4 GPU, which would be `compute_75`.

For example:

```shell
CUDA_DOCKER_ARCH=compute_75 LLAMA_CUDA=1 make -j
```

### NVCC not found

```
/bin/sh: 1: nvcc: not found
```

You need to add CUDA path to your shell environmental variables.

For example, with Bash and CUDA 12:

```
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda-12/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda-12/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

### cannot find -lcuda

```
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcuda: No such file or directory
```

That means your Nvidia drivers are not installed. Install NVIDIA Drivers first.

### Cannot communicate with NVIDIA driver

```
NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.
```

If you installed the drivers, reboot the instance.

### Failed to decode the batch

```
failed to decode the batch, n_batch = 0, ret = -1
main: llama_decode() failed
```

There are two potential causes of this issue.

#### Option 1: Install NVIDIA drivers

Make sure you have installed the CUDA Toolkit and NVIDIA drivers. If you do, restart your server and try again. Most likely, NVIDIA kernel modules are not loaded.

```shell
sudo reboot
```

#### Option 2: Use different benchmarking parameters

For example, with `Mistral Instruct 7B` what worked for me is:

```shell
./batched-bench ../mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf 2048 2048 512 0 999 128,256,512 128,256 1,2,4,8,16,32
```
