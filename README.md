# Paddler

Digital products and their users need privacy, reliability, cost control and an option to be independent from third party vendors.

Paddler is an open-source LLMOps platform for organizations that host and scale open-source models in their own infrastructure.

## Key features

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19e74262-1918-4b1d-9b4c-bcb4f0ab79f5">

* Inference through a built-in [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) engine
* Load balancing
* Works through agents that can be added dynamically, allowing integration with autoscaling tools
* Request buffering, enabling scaling from zero hosts
* Built-in web admin panel for management, monitoring and testing
* Observability metrics

## For whom?

* Product teams that need LLM inference and embeddings in their features
* DevOps/LLMOps teams that need to run and deploy LLMs at scale
* Organizations handling sensitive data with high compliance and privacy requirements (medical, financial, etc.)
* Organizations wanting to achieve predictable LLM costs instead of being exposed to per-token pricing
* Product leaders who need reliable model performance to maintain consistent user experience of their AI-based features

## Documentation

Visit our [documentation page](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/introduction/what-is-paddler/) to install Paddler and get started with it. 

[API documentation](https://paddler.intentee.com/api/introduction/using-paddler-api/) is also available.

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install Paddler, but the goal is to obtain the `paddler` binary and make it available in your system.

You can:

* Option 1: Download the latest release from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/intentee/paddler/releases)
* Option 2: Build Paddler from source

### Using Paddler

The entire Paddler functionality is available through the `paddler` command.

You can run `paddler --help` to see the available commands and options.

## How does it work?

Paddler is built for an easy set up. It comes as a self-contained binary with only two deployable components, the `balancer` and the `agents`. 

The `balancer` exposes the following:

- Inference service (used by applications that connect to it to obtain tokens or embeddings)
- Management service, which manages the Paddler's setup internally
- Web admin panel that lets you view and test your Paddler setup

`Agents` are usually deployed on separate instances. They further distribute the incoming requests to `slots`, which are responsible for generating tokens and embeddings.

Paddler uses a built-in llama.cpp engine for inference, but has its own implementation of llama.cpp slots which keep their own context and KV cache.

### Web admin panel

Paddler comes with a built-in web admin panel. 

You can use it to monitor your Paddler fleet:

Add and update your model and customize the chat template and inference parameters:

And use GUI to test the inference:

## Why the Name

We initially wanted to use [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm (thus Paddler, because it paddles on a Raft), but eventuall dropped that idea. The name stayed, though.

Later, people started sending us the "that's a paddlin'" clip from The Simpsons, and we just embraced it.
